This is a simple example of using [Google Authenticator library](https://github.com/wstrange/GoogleAuth) in a spring boot
enabled app.

It is composed of three simple views and a controller that makes all th job.

you can just start it up, and the system will generate a code for you , the make a validation.

It you take more than 30 sec in make the validation, it will fail.

I hope this skeleton helps you to make poc faster.
